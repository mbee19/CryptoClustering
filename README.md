# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge for Morgan Bee

In this challenge, I used all class activities, lecture notes, and Khaled's large notebook from the module to help me through the tasks. 

I used this stack overflow article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57293716/sklearn-pca-explained-variance-and-explained-variance-ratio-difference to help me understand when to use explained variance and explained variance ratio and how to understand both. 

In the final question, I used google's AI to help me understand the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data in order to answer the question.
